                <p>I started learning C++ when I was in 11th grade. Since, then I have developed a huge interest in it
                  and in addition to that I am exploring and improving my knowledge on daily basis. It's a fun language. I have worked on a game of snakes in C++ in 11th grade
                  and was really appreciated by the teachers and also developed a project on school fees structure in C++.</p>
